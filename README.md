## This is a work in progress!
Hello there! My friend and I work on this a few times a week, but this library isn't ready to be consumed in any form just yet. As soon as we think it's ready to try out, we'll give it a version number that will be prominently featured somewhere. Until then, feel free to contact me ([@benasher44](https://github.com/benasher44)) via email or Twitter to inquire about progress.

Cheers!

Ben
